# .aiignore - Commands to Never Execute

## Build Commands - NEVER RUN
npm run build
npm run production
npm run prod
yarn build
yarn production
vite build

## Other Potentially Dangerous Commands
rm -rf
rmdir /s
git push --force
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed (in production)
composer update (without testing)

## Deployment Commands - Only in CI/CD
npm run build
npm run production
composer install --no-dev
php artisan optimize

## Notes
- Always work with source files
- Let the build pipeline handle compilation
- Test changes with dev server (npm run dev)
- Build artifacts are generated during deployment
